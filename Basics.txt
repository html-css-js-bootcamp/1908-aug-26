# Full Stack Web Application

## Client-Side
    - Applications/technologies which runs/executes at the Client.
    - Client is the machine at user's end
    - basically it is the web browser (chrome, IE, Edge, Firefox, Safari ....)
    - Client side technologies( also sometimes know as FrontEnd) include : HTML, CSS, Angular, React

## Server-Side
    - Application/technologies which runs/executes on Server.
    - Server is a computer on web (www) which has a unique IP Address (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx).
    - xxx-> 0 to 255
    - IP Addresses are complex to remember for the user so we prefer to use DNS (which is an alias to IP address).
    - technologies include - C#, Java, .Net, Asp.Net, php, python....
    - Server-side technologies can interact with files system and also can communicate to Database server 
    (which Client side technology cannot do).

## Backend 
    - Backend includes Database server.
    - Database is a logical collection of tables.
    - Tables consists of rows and columns 
    - DBMS (DataBase Management System) refers to the software which manages the DataBase (Db).
    - Eg: Sql Server(Microsoft), OracleDb(Oracle), Postgres, Cloud DB (Azure, AWS, GCP).

- To develop a full stack Application we need the technologies(FrontEnd, Backend, server side)
- For developers IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is required . Eg: VSCode, Visual Studio, Eclipse, Spring
- IDE has code editor windows, File explorer, extensions etc....


# HTML 
-  It stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. Its not a programming language.
-  Typically HTML is used to create a web page/website.
-  The extension of an HTML file is .HTML
-  It is not case sensitive HTML is same as HTml or html or Html....
-  It runs on the web browser.
-  *TAG* - this starts with < and ends with >
-  Tags can be opening tag <tagname>  and closing tag(tag name starts with /) </tagname>
-  self-closing tags tags which donot need any closing tag.
